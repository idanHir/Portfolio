## ðŸš€ Projects

### [Ascii Art Generator](https://github.com/idanHir/AsciiArt)
**Language:** Java  

A program that converts images into ASCII art.  
- Implements image processing, character matching, and custom rendering.  
- Organized into packages: `ascii_art`, `ascii_output`, `image`, `image_char_matching`.  
- Written in pure Java (no external dependencies).  

**How to run:**  
```
javac src/**/*.java
java -cp src ascii_art.Main
```

### [Snakes and Ladders with Markov chains](https://github.com/idanHir/tweets_generator)
**Language:** C  

A simulation of the Snakes and Ladders game, powered by Markov chains.  
- Implements linked lists and probability-based transitions.
- Two modes: text generation (tweets) and game simulation.
- Memory management with dynamic allocation in C.

**How to build:**  
```
make snake     # for Snakes and Ladders
make tweets    # for text generator
```
Additional explanations regarding each project are provided in the README file of its respective repository.

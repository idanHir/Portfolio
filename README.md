### [Ascii Art Generator](https://github.com/idanHir/ascii-art)
**Language:** Java  

A program that converts images into ASCII art.  
- Implements image processing, character matching, and custom rendering.

java -cp src ascii_art.Main
```

### [Snakes and Ladders with Markov chains](https://github.com/idanHir/tweets_generator)
**Language:** C  

A simulation of the Snakes and Ladders game, powered by Markov chains.  
- Implements linked lists and probability-based transitions.
- Two modes: text generation (tweets) and game simulation.
- Memory management with dynamic allocation in C.

**How to build:**  
```
make snake     # for Snakes and Ladders
make tweets    # for text generator
```
